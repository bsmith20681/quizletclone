# Quizlet Clone 

Quizlet Clone is an app used to create virtual flashcards to help someone study. It was my attempt in replicating www.quizlet.com flashcard feature. It allows for a user to create multiple flashcards and then click on the card itself to rotate it to see what is on the back.

## Getting Started

Simply download the files and run them in your favorite web browser!

### Prerequisites

If you plan on changing any of the SASS code, then you will want to have a compiler ready. I recommend using Koala if you have never used a SASS compiler before. 

## Built With
